Ever thought how we can find the **fake articles/news** that do get spread in the world of internet very easily?

Now thanks to the AI we can easily find the fake news and tell you which one is the correct article.

We are using Tensorflow model through which we will be finding out the [**fake news**](https://github.com/subhan97ahmed/fake-news-detector-backend).
